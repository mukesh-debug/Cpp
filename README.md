# Cpp
This repository is strictly for storage of c++ scripts.

The script files are compiled to .out file using g++ (gcc compiler notation for c++ files) compiler version 9.3.0 or latest.
c++ files may have other extensions too for comilation using gcc like,
.cpp, .cxx, .C (capital c), .cp, .cc, .CPP etc.

for getting more debugging info use '-g' and '-Wall' options of g++.
$g++ -g -Wall filename.cc -o filename.out


Since I switched to python for about a year and since have not used c++,
 thus some programs would be beginner level to practice some changes.
Also, now i am using g++ on linux and not a IDE like Dev c++
which i am used to also adapting to some recent developments in c++ versions for which i need practice.
