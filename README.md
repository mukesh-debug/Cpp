# Cpp
This repository is strictly for storage of c++ scripts.

The script files are compiled to .out file using g++ compiler version 9.3.0 or latest.

Since I switched to python for about a year and since have not used c++,
 thus some programs would be beginner level to practice some changes.
Also, now i am using g++ on linux and not a IDE like Dev c++
which i am used to and recent developments in c++ versions, i need practice.
